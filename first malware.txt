first malware created to affect mobile devices - 

Cabir was the first known malware created to infect mobile devices, discovered in 2004. It was a Bluetooth-based worm that targeted Nokia mobile phones running Symbian OS (Series 60). The virus spread by continuously sending itself to nearby devices through Bluetooth; once a user accepted the file, the phone became infected. After infection, the mobile phone displayed the message “Caribe”, often along with a skull symbol. Cabir did not steal data or damage files, but it caused problems such as rapid battery drain, slow performance, and kept Bluetooth active all the time. The main purpose of Cabir was proof of concept, showing that mobile phones could also be affected by malware. It was created by the 29A virus writing group and marked the beginning of mobile malware history.
